#Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting
Step 1: Understanding Recursive Algorithms
i) Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, typically until it reaches a base case.
Uses of Recursion:
•	Simplifies problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems
•	Common in calculations like factorials, Fibonacci, and here: compound forecasting
Step 2: Setup - Future Value Formula
We use the compound growth formula:
                            FV=PV×(1+r)^n
Where:
•	FV = Future Value
•	PV = Present Value
•	r = growth rate per period (as decimal)
•	n = number of periods (e.g., years)

Step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity:
•	Recursive calls: one per year → O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of years.
•	Space complexity: also O(n) due to the recursive call stack.
Optimization Tips:
1.	Avoid Recalculating:
o	If intermediate results are reused, store them using memoization.
2.	Use Iteration:
o	Convert recursion to a loop for better performance and avoid stack overflow.
